# Stoccer

##### About the Project 

Stoccer is a Fantasy Trading Game in the world of soccer. Users are able to buy, sell and share tokens ***- or shares -*** of their teams. They will, then, compete against each other and *"the market"*. 

A more detailed White Paper will be published shortly.

###### Tools
We are aiming for a fast development so we can focus on UX/UI, so being efficient and simple is not only required but **necessary**. 

However, the tools are not yet set in stone and we are continuously researching our possibilities. This will probably be better discussed within Issues
